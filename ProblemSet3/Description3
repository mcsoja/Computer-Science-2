Implementation of a variation of Dijkstra's 2-stack algorithm for evaluating infix arithmetic expressions 
involving integers combined with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `^` operators as well as parentheses. 
The code required for this problem set reads a sequence of strings (or tokens) from the input that form an 
arithmetic expression.
